# Guess The Word Game

Guess the Wiord is a word guessing game that can be played directly in your internet browser. The user will see the category of the word on the screen and try to guess it by choosing some letters that will be filled in on the screen if the user guesses correctly.

As letters are correct the word will be created on the screen, until the player hits all the letters.

The user will have 5 chances, if he misses the word, he loses! And a modal appears on the screen and he will have a chance to restart the game for one more chance.

## **Target Audiences**

- Children and Teenagers

# UX (User Experencie)

## Project Goals

The aim of the project is to make it a simple and intuitive site for children and teenagers who are starting to get in touch with web games.

Categories and words will be renewed each time the game is restarted, this will motivate the child to play several times.

##User Goals

- Casual game.

- Someone who is looking for fun.

- Knowledge of new words for the child.

- Easy to use.

- Be quick and easy to start and complete.

- Be able to restart and keep playing.

## Design 

- __Typography__

### Fonts 

Shadows Into Light Two is the perfect font for all fun gaming websites. It draws the user's attention and creates an idea of fun. 
The fonts were imported to the stylesheet via Google fonts.

## Possible Future Features

In the future I will add more categories and words, so that it doesn't become a boring game with few word options. And I also want to create a Quiz with questions and answers on the same page, so that it becomes a page with more game options.
