# Guess The Word Game

Guess the Wiord is a word guessing game that can be played directly in your internet browser. The user will see the category of the word on the screen and try to guess it by choosing some letters that will be filled in on the screen if the user guesses correctly.

As letters are correct the word will be created on the screen, until the player hits all the letters.

The user will have 5 chances, if he misses the word, he loses! And a modal appears on the screen and he will have a chance to restart the game for one more chance.
